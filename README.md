# Getting Started with React Native

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (using either [Expo](https://expo.dev/) or [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the Metro bundler and opens the development tools.
You can then run the app on a simulator, emulator, or physical device.

For Expo projects, this will open Expo Dev Tools in your browser.

### `npm run android`

Builds the app and runs it on a connected Android device or emulator.
Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected.

### `npm run ios`

Builds the app and runs it on a connected iOS simulator or device (macOS only).
You need to have Xcode installed and an iOS simulator available.

### `npm test`

Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

For Expo projects: If you need full native code access, you can `eject` to a bare React Native project.
This will give you full control over the native Android and iOS code.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).

If youâ€™re using Expo, check out the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

### Running on a Physical Device

For Expo projects, install the **Expo Go** app on your device and scan the QR code from your terminal or Expo Dev Tools.

For bare React Native projects, connect your device via USB and run `npm run android` or `npm run ios`.

### Debugging

You can debug React Native apps using [React DevTools](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging) and your preferred IDE.
